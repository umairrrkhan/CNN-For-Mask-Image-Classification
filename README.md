# Convolutional Neural Networks for Mask Image Classification

## Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques and the TensorFlow framework to classify images into two categories: "with mask" and "without mask." The goal is to develop a robust system that can assist in enforcing mask-wearing policies and promote public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images with individuals wearing masks and images of individuals without masks. It's important to have a balanced dataset to ensure the model's effectiveness.

## Model Architecture

We employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract features and classify the images. The model is trained to distinguish between masked and unmasked faces.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/umairrrkhan/CNN-For-Mask-Image-Classification/>
cd mask-image-classification
```

## Results

Evaluate the model's performance on your dataset and report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness.
